# GetHarley Data Analyst Challenge

## Background

The dataset of 6M-0K-99K.users.dataset.public.csv is based on an open
source dataset of registered user profiles on a C2C fashion store based in
France.

The C2C store is different from a B2C store in that users are both sellers
(uploading their products) and the buyers (by purchasing other userâ€™s
products).
The company makes a commission from the sellers based on a % of the
listing price of the products.
