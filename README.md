# GetHarley Data Analyst Challenge

## Background

The dataset of [6M-0K-99K.users.dataset.public.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Jkk4LZh6u9a5hyskXz4g5p0iAEkzqrS/view) is based on an [open source dataset](https://data.world/jfreex/e-commerce-users-of-a-french-c2c-fashion-store) of registered user profiles on a C2C fashion store based in
France.

The C2C store is different from a B2C store in that users are both sellers
(uploading their products) and the buyers (by purchasing other userâ€™s
products).

The company makes a commission from the sellers based on a % of the
listing price of the products.

## Objectives
Please assume that you have been tasked with conducting exploratory data
analysis for the C2C store company (and it is the first time any analysis of
their user base is carried out).

We would like to see from your analysis of the dataset:
1. A short summary of the **top 3 insights** you would draw from the
dataset that you think would benefit the company to be aware of.
(assuming no previous analysis has ever been carried out on this data)
2. **One** actionable recommendation from you for the business to increase
their revenue from the data analysis carried out.

## Submission Format
You may use any tool/language of your choice to conduct the analysis and
any method of sharing the analysis.
You should assume that the summary and actionable recommendation
should be in a format digestible by the CEO of the C2C business.
We request that your submission includes:
1. The summary of insights and the actionable recommendation
2. Any code written to conduct the analysis
3. Any visualisations to aide the analysis
4. Access to the raw analysis
For example, a submission using a Google Colab notebook containing
Python inline code, visualisations, raw analysis and a summary is one
possible option.
